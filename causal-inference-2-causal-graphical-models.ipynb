    "In a [previous blog post](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2018/Mar/24/causal-inference-with-python-part-1-potential-outcomes/) I discussed how we can use the idea of [potential outcomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model) to make causal inferences from observational data. Under the Potential Outcomes framework we treat the counterfactual outcome as if it were [missing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data) and attempt to estimate these missing values from the observed data. To do this we needed to make strong assumptions about the data generating process, specifically \"Strong Ignorability\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $Y_{i}$ are the potential outcomes we are trying to estimate, $X$ is the intervention we are trying to measure and $Z$ are a set of covariates which allow us to \"correct\" our estimate. This statement should be read: \"$Y_{i}$ is conditional independent of $X$ given $Z$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a strong statement about the process which generated our data. In order to understand where strong ignorability hold, we need to make some assumptions about the _structure_ of the data generating process itself. The language we will be using to express this structure is that of Causal Graphical Models. In this post I will try to give an light overview of causal graphical model using a [python package of the same name](https://github.com/ijmbarr/causalgraphicalmodels). \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to my previous post, this post will be less about techniques to make causal inferences and more on gaining intuition about how we can describe data generating structure and what statements we can make once we have such a description. I am also not going to be playing fast and loose with some of the maths "

    "Given the focus on potential outcomes that my previous post had, it is worth asking what the relationship between causal graphical models and them is. It turns out that the two approaches are exactly equivalent to each other, and a statement in one can be related to a statement in the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a slight subtle point that so far I've treated causal graphical models as a way to make statements about _causal inference_ (how data would be generated if there is an intervention on the system), whereas potential outcomes describe _counterfactual inference_ (what would have happened to a system which had already been observed, if a different treatment had been applied), but it is possible to use CGMs/SCMs to reason about counterfactuals, although it is beyond these notes.\n",

However, there are a number of statistical techniques we can use to make this estimate. For example, my previous most covered a number of ways to estimate the quantity $E[Y|X,Z]$ from potentially biased observations, which is often what we care about instead of the full distribution."

    "The backdoor adjustment method is one example of identification discussed in these notes - it is not the only one. In my [next post](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2018/Sep/03/causal-inference-with-python-part-3-frontdoor-adjustment/) I will look at how we can use mediating variables to make causal inferences. More generally, [it has been shown](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-191.pdf) that for partly observed causal graphical models it is possible to decide exactly whether or not a causal statement is identifiable and the rules of do-calculus are complete. \n",

    "In the other direction, learning causal structure is much more difficult. There are [some tools](http://www.phil.cmu.edu/tetrad/) out there to estimate structure, but in my experience, when guided only by the data they tend to produce nonsensical results. I suspect this is because given only limited observational data there often is not enough information to accurately estimate structure. There is some [interested work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01332) on how to use combinations of observational data from different setting to try and infer structure, but I think in general this is an open problem.\n",
